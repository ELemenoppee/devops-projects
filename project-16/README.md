# Deploying a Docker Application to Kubernetes

Deploying applications in Kubernetes requires a structured process to ensure that Docker images are properly stored, accessible, and deployed within the cluster. In this guide, I will walk you through how I pushed a Docker image to a private registry and deployed it in Kubernetes.

This article is a continuation of my previous post on Deploying a Static Website with Docker, where I shared how to containerize and serve a static website. Now, Iâ€™m taking it a step further by deploying a Dockerized application in Kubernetes!

## Step 1: Logging in to the Private Docker Registry

Before pushing my image, I first authenticated with my private Docker registry using the following command:

```sh
docker login -uadmin <docker_registry_ip_address>:5000
```

Example output:

## Step 2: Tagging the Docker Image

To push the image to the registry, I tagged it with the registryâ€™s IP address and port:

```sh
docker tag test-portfolio <docker_registry_ip_address>:5000/test-portfolio
```

Example output:

## Step 3: Pushing the Image to the Private Registry

After tagging, I pushed the image to my private registry:

```sh
docker push <docker_registry_ip_address>:5000/test-portfolio
```

Example output:

## Step 4: Verifying the Image in the Registry

To confirm that the image was stored successfully, I ran a container using the newly tagged image:

```sh
docker run -ti -p 8080:80 <docker_registry_ip_address>:5000/test-portfolio
```

At this stage, the image was now available in the private registry and could be accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions.

## Step 5: Deploying the Application in Kubernetes

Next, I deployed the application in Kubernetes by creating a pod using the image from my private registry:

```sh
kubectl run test-portfolio --restart=Never --image=<docker_registry_ip_address>:5000/test-portfolio --port=80
```

Example output:

To confirm the pod was running, I checked the list of pods:

```sh
kubect get pods
```

Example output:

Step 6: Exposing the Application

To make the application accessible, I exposed it as a service:

```sh
kubectl expose pods test-portfolio --type=NodePort --port=80
```

To verify that the service was successfully created, I listed all services:

```sh
kubectl get services
```

Example output:

## Step 7: Accessing the Application in the Browser

Finally, I found the external port assigned to the application and opened it in a web browser to verify that it was accessible.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, I successfully pushed a Docker image to a private registry and deployed it in a Kubernetes cluster. This setup ensures that my application is properly managed, scalable, and accessible within the infrastructure.
